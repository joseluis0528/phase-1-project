The Weather App

As someone who is constantly checking for daily weather updates, –– who isn't, right? –– I decided that it would be nice to create my very own weather app/website as my first project. I knew that I wanted to include a name for my website, date, city search bar in which the user would type in a city and in return get the city name, current, highest and lowest temperature for the day, the weather description and icon, humidity, and wind. I really enjoyed building this and I feel a lot better when working with API's. Going into this I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to create such thing, or that I wouldn't be able to create what I envisioned but looking at it now I can honestly say I am proud of the end result. I 100% plan on revisiting and modifying this project by adding new features such as a map of the forecast, a button that will  switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius, an hourly and 10 day forecast tab, and also work on a better design in general.

Below I will provide some link resources that I used during this project.
